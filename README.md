## Cite

It's not expected that you cite paramGUI directly, rather cite the [TIMP](https://github.com/glotaran/TIMP) package on which it was built. However, if you'd like to let us know how you are using it (e.g. in teaching) please don't hesitate to reach out, we'd love to know!

## Contributors

The first version of paramGUI was created by [Katharine Mullen](https://github.com/k-m-m) and [Ivo van Stokkum](https://github.com/ism200) in 2008, but was never released to the public.

In 2016 [Joris Snellenburg](https://github.com/jsnel) created a shiny new web app based frontend for the package and released it to CRAN as version 2.0. He is also the current maintainer of the package.
